### Built With

This "monorepo" is packaged together with git submodules. You can check out the individual repos:

- [React client](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/tchat-react-client)
- [Fastify server](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/tchat-fastify-server)

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo was to help me learn about tRPC and Websockets. It is also meant to give an example of how to get all of these technologies to get to work together. This is my third attempt so hopefully it can help me or others in the future.
